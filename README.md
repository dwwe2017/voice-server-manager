#### What is TeamSpeak / TeamSpeak?
This is software that enables straightforward and efficient communication within the group.
These so-called voice servers are used particularly frequently in the gaming sector, for example within
Clans or guild communities. In contrast to conventional communication services, voice servers are special
designed to network large groups of users with minimal response time (ping).
